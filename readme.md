# Chess Bot (C#)
## By Nick Glenn

A chess bot written in C#, using the Raylib_cs library
Heavily influenced by Sebastian Lague's "Chess AI" mini-series

Requires .NET 6.0 and up

Thanks to [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) for both the unintentional recommendation of using Raylib_cs as a graphical libarary and some snippets from [his project](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge)\
Thanks to Yaroslav Bondarev for open sourcing [Stockfish.NET](https://github.com/Oremiro/Stockfish.NET) and using that to integrate the UCI protocol with Stockfish
